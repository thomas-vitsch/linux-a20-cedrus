Device-Tree bindings for SUNXI video engine found in sunXi SoC family

Required properties:
- compatible	    : "allwinner,sun5i-a13-video-engine";
- memory-region     : DMA pool for buffers allocation;
- clocks	    : list of clock specifiers, corresponding to
		      entries in clock-names property;
- clock-names	    : should contain "ahb", "mod" and "ram" entries;
- resets	    : phandle for reset;
- interrupts	    : should contain VE interrupt number;
- reg		    : should contain register base and length of VE.

Example:

reserved-memory {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;

	ve_reserved: cma {
		compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
		reg = <0x43d00000 0x9000000>;
		no-map;
		linux,cma-default;
	};
};

video-engine {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun5i-a13-video-engine";
	memory-region = <&ve_reserved>;

	clocks = <&ahb_gates 32>, <&ccu CLK_VE>,
		 <&dram_gates 0>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "mod", "ram";

	assigned-clocks = <&ccu CLK_VE>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <320000000>;

	resets = <&ccu RST_VE>;

	interrupts = <53>;

	reg = <0x01c0e000 4096>;
};
